# Deformation Analysis using Computer Vision

A project that applies image-processing techniques to identify and quantify structural deformations like cracks or shifts in built structures.

By analyzing before-and-after photos, the system identifies and highlights affected areas, which is particularly useful for civil engineering, infrastructure monitoring, and safety assessment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Data Input**  
   Loads sets of structural photos (e.g., building columns) in defined folders.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   Converts to grayscale, applies filters and thresholding to enhance crack visibility.

3. **Deformation Detection**  
   Uses feature detection, contour analysis, or pixel differencing to identify changes across images.

4. **Visualization**  
   Displays deformations overlaid on original images in a Jupyter Notebook.

5. **User Interpretation**  
   Engineers can interpret the patterns visually and adjust thresholds for sensitivity.
