## This project applies computer vision techniques to monitor and analyze physical deformations in structural elements such as columns or walls. It's a useful tool in civil and structural engineering, particularly for assessing wear, damage, or stress over time. By using image processing algorithms (likely edge detection, comparison techniques, or pixel-based tracking), the system helps identify areas of concern based on visual evidence. The provided notebook likely walks through a workflow where pre- and post-deformation images are analyzed to quantify the extent of damage. While the project is simple, it sets the stage for integration with real-time video feeds or AI-powered crack classification, making it highly extensible for smart infrastructure applications.
