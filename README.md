### Established an earthquake simulating environment using OpenCV in Python for analysing the stress and strain of an object. Developed interface for realtime analysis of the same with ReactJS and Django.

### This project consists of a block completely marked with points and usage of Image Processing libraries in Python like OpenCV to process the stress and strain endured by the block based on the trajectories of the moved point.
